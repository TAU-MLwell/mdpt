Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a significant public health issue both in the United States and globally. It is characterized by a gradual loss of kidney function over time, which can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation.

**Epidemiology:**
- **Prevalence:** CKD affects approximately 15% of the adult population in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Worldwide, the prevalence varies but is estimated to affect about 10% of the global population.
- **Risk Factors:** Major risk factors include diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and a family history of kidney disease. Age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic factors also play a role, with higher prevalence observed in African American, Hispanic, and Native American populations.

**Medical Context:**
- **Diagnosis:** CKD is diagnosed based on the presence of kidney damage or decreased kidney function for three months or more, using markers such as albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) provides guidelines for staging CKD from stage 1 (mild) to stage 5 (severe).
- **Symptoms:** Early stages may be asymptomatic, but as the disease progresses, symptoms can include fatigue, swelling, changes in urination, and high blood pressure.

**Guidelines in the US:**
- **Management:** The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the NKF provide guidelines for the management of CKD, emphasizing blood pressure control, glycemic management in diabetes, lifestyle modifications, and regular monitoring of kidney function.
- **Treatment:** Treatment strategies include the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors or ARBs to slow progression, dietary modifications, and management of complications like anemia and bone mineral disorders.

This structured information provides a comprehensive overview of CKD for epidemiological research, highlighting its prevalence, risk factors, diagnostic criteria, management guidelines, and key references for further exploration.

Since 2000, there have been several significant global and local policy changes regarding the diagnosis and treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD). These changes have been driven by the increasing recognition of CKD as a major public health issue and the need for standardized approaches to its management.

**Global Policy Changes:**

1. **2002 - Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO):** Established to develop and implement global clinical practice guidelines in nephrology. KDIGO has released several guidelines on CKD diagnosis and management, emphasizing the importance of early detection and intervention.

2. **2004 - World Health Organization (WHO) Resolution on Chronic Diseases:** Recognized CKD as part of the global burden of chronic diseases, prompting member states to develop strategies for prevention and control.

3. **2012 - KDIGO CKD Guidelines Update:** Provided updated guidelines on the evaluation and management of CKD, including new definitions and staging criteria based on eGFR and albuminuria.

**Local Policy Changes in the United States:**

1. **2000 - National Kidney Foundation (NKF) Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI):** Released the first clinical practice guidelines for CKD, which standardized the definition and staging of CKD in the U.S.

2. **2006 - Medicare Coverage for CKD Education:** The U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) began covering kidney disease education services for patients with CKD stages 4 and 5, aiming to improve patient outcomes through better understanding and management of the disease.

3. **2017 - Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative:** Launched by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of kidney diseases, with goals to reduce the number of Americans developing ESRD and increase access to kidney transplantation.
